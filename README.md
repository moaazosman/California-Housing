# California-Housing
The goal is to provide valuable insights and predictions in understanding the factors influencing housing prices in California.
To prepare the data for analysis, a square root transformation was applied to the variables 
['housing_median_age', 'total_rooms', 'total_bedrooms', 'population', 'households', 
'median_income']. This transformation helped to make the distribution more symmetrical and 
reduce skewness, resulting in a more balanced representation of the data.
